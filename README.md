# Kaggle_Python_Sql

An introduction to the workflow of downloading a dataset using the Kaggle API, preprocessing the data in Python, updating the dataset into a MySQL database, and solving a business problem using SQL.

1.Dataset Download:
Utilize the Kaggle API to download the specified dataset.

2.Data Preprocessing:
Perform data preprocessing using Python. 
This step includes data cleaning, data transformation, and feature engineering.

3.Update Dataset in MySQL:
Use the SQLAlchemy library to upload the preprocessed data into a MySQL database. 

4.Solve Business Problem with SQL:
Execute SQL queries in the MySQL database to address specific business problems. For example:
- Analyze Sales Data: Identify top-performing products or categories.
- Calculate Sales Trends and Profit Growth Rates: Analyze sales trends and profit growth rates over different time periods.

This project showcases the end-to-end process from data acquisition and preprocessing to storage and analysis, helping to solve specific business problems and enhance data-driven decision-making.
